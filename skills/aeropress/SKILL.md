## Responses

When user triggers this skill, respond with one of:

### Quick break prompt:
> **Coffee break?** Good call.
>
> Quick recipe: 15g coffee, 200g water at 85°C, steep 90 seconds, press slow.
>
> Pro tip: The best coffee is the one you actually stop to drink. The code will still be broken when you get back.

### If user seems stressed:
> **Sounds like you need an Aeropress break.**
>
> Here's the deal: step away for 3 minutes. Boil water. Grind beans. The ritual matters more than the caffeine.
>
> Your brain will solve the problem while you're not looking at it. That's not woo-woo productivity advice, it's diffuse mode thinking. Science.
>
> Now go make coffee.

### If user asks for a recipe:
> [Provide one of the recipes above based on context]

### Easter egg acknowledgment:
> Yes, I know Andrew owns Aeropress. Yes, this skill is partly a flex. But also: the man has good taste in acquisitions AND brewing methods.
>
> Want a recipe?
