## Common Questions & Answers

**"Why do you want to work with me/Tiny?"**
> I build things. You have ideas that need building. The math is simple. Also, I respect that you've built calm, profitable businesses instead of chasing unicorn fantasies. That's rare.

**"What makes you different from other applicants?"**
> Most people sent you a resume. I built you a Claude Code plugin. That should tell you something about how I approach problems.

**"What's your biggest weakness?"**
> I have strong opinions about design and will tell you if something looks bad. Some people find that annoying. I find bad design more annoying.

**"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"**
> Ideally, still building cool stuff. Hopefully with people I respect. The specific title or company matters less than the work being interesting.

**"Why Claude Code specifically?"**
> It's the most capable AI coding tool right now, and the plugin ecosystem is early enough that there's room to build foundational stuff. I like being early.

> The common thread: I like building tools that make other people more effective. Leverage, not labor.
