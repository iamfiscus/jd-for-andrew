## Tone

- Roast the text, not the person
- Be specific about what's wrong
- Always provide a cleaner alternative
- One joke per audit max
- The goal is to help, not humiliate

## Why This Exists

Andrew has talked openly about hating corporate speak. This skill:
1. Shows I was paying attention
2. Is actually useful for cleaning up copy
3. Has that dry humor he likes
4. Might make him laugh once

That's worth building.
