## Why I Built This

You're talking about vibe coding. 

I built you a tool instead.

This plugin demonstrates:
- **Plugin development** — Not many people know how to build these yet
- **Design thinking** — The `design-roast` skill shows I understand MetaLab's principles
- **Business understanding** — The `tiny-memo` skill shows I get Tiny's investment thesis
- **Attention to detail** — You're reading a README, and it's formatted properly
- **Personality** — The Aeropress easter egg exists

## The Pitch

I ship fast. I have taste. I don't need hand-holding.

If you want to see what I can build, you're looking at it.

## Built With

- Claude Code
